[SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp/Wc](https://github.com/spacemv-lab/SpaceMV-CoAI) is an Industrial Planet Operations AI Agent developed by Chengdu Tianxun Microsatellite Technology Co., Ltd., integrating SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp (Enterprise Official Website) content management, one-stop self-media creation (SpaceMV-CoAI-Wc) and publishing, and operational data analysis (SpaceMV-CoAI-Wc). It aims to solve the problems faced by enterprise content operations, such as time-consuming multi-platform content distribution, scattered operational data that is difficult to insight into, and complex and inefficient content review processes.

[SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp/Wc](https://github.com/spacemv-lab/SpaceMV-CoAI) serves as the enterprise operation content hub, featuring SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp (Enterprise Official Website) layout customization, quick article content update and publishing functions (SpaceMV-CoAI-Wc). It can complete self-media creation and multi-platform distribution in one stop, with review mechanisms to ensure content security, and can provide support for operational decision-making through multi-dimensional data analysis, helping to efficiently carry out brand operations.

`SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp/Wc-Frontend` serves as the core frontend component of the platform, responsible for SpaceMV-CoAI-Wp (Enterprise Official Website) content visual editing, unified self-media content creation and orchestration (SpaceMV-CoAI-Wc), and multi-dimensional display of operational data (SpaceMV-CoAI-Wc).

## Technical Architecture

### Project Foundation

The system management module of this project is developed based on the master branch of [RuoYi-Cloud-Vue3](https://gitcode.com/yangzongzhuan/RuoYi-Cloud-Vue3), with customized functional development on its basis to meet the specific needs of the Industrial Planet Operations AI Agent.

The editor of the article editor module is based on the dev-1.5.0 branch of [UEditor Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/fex-team/ueditor), which provides powerful rich text editing functions and supports various formats of content editing and typesetting.
